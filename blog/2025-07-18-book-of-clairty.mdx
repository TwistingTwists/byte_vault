Why do startups fail? 


Mental Models? 

- Idea evaluation framework?
- 


Attempted multiple startups during college - failed -- mine always failed. WHY?  
wingify -- 5th attempt at startup. 
- 50k per month -> quit job 
- visualise website optimiser -> 18mo for 1m USD ->> 400 cr revenue (50m usd)


comprehension is what matters -- not the core work. core job.
-- book reader - do the quiz. remember it. 




## rare + valuable 

- desire fulfill - substantially better. 
- mastering multiple skills until no one has the mix -- rare and valuable
- fb = dating(valuable) + only-one (rare)
- what people want + how they are currently being serviced (current methods should be PAINFUL)
  - you can only identify. you cannot change desire of the people. neither can you change what other people offer to solve the problem 
  - needed = insight + iteration + luck 




- WANT
  - fulfillment => better + cheaper + faster
    - fulfillment -- methods keep on improving ways to fullfill desire.
      - music -> casettes to spotify
      - finding information -> library and yellow pages to google 
 
  - know => REVEALED preferences
    - speak (customer) == lol. wallet should speak.
  -   



## Bezos letter
- customers are always dissatified (they want something better. ALWAYS)== your desire to delight customers will make you invent on their behalf.
- what will change in 10 yrs? -- meh. 
- what will NOT change in 10 yrs? -- business strategy around that is stable. 
  - retail customer = low price + fast delivery + vast selection 


### Who to serve?

Why to startups exist?? 
- established behaviours of customers => being serviced one way or another by 'established' busniess!


- `extreme user` needs are SO different than the masses. and established business ignore that. this is BURNING PAIN. (PAIN is where the wallet is.)
  - last minute traveller - needs place to sleep (not fancy pillows) - airbnb
  - last minute traveller - uber 
- 


- dissatified minority best -- 
-
