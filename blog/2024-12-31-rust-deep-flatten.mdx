### Deep Flattening in Rust: A Recursive Adventure

Flattening nested data structures is a common problem in programming. However, flattening structures with an arbitrary depth—like nested `Vec`s within `Vec`s—can be tricky. Rust, with its strong type system and trait-based polymorphism, allows us to implement elegant solutions to such problems. In this post, we'll explore a recursive approach to deep flattening in Rust using traits, type inference, and iterators.

#### The Goal

Given a deeply nested structure, such as:

```rust
let nested_vec = vec![
    vec![vec![1, 2, 3], vec![4, 5]],
    vec![vec![6], vec![7, 8, 9]],
];
```

Our goal is to flatten it into:

```rust
let flattened = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
```
{/* truncate */}

The depth of nesting is not fixed—it could be `Vec<Vec<Vec<T>>>`, `Vec<Vec<Vec<Vec<T>>>>`, or deeper.

### TL;DR: high level idea

Rust’s iterators and traits allow us to create a type-safe, recursive implementation to handle deep flattening. The solution uses three key components:

1. **The **Trait**: A recursive trait defining how to flatten iterators.
2. **Base and Recursive Implementations**: Separate implementations for handling the base case (non-nested items) and recursive case (nested items).
3. **A Wrapper Struct**: A helper type to simplify type inference.

### Implementation

The fun part lies in using Rust's types as in recursive way.

#### The `DeepFlattenIteratorOf` Trait

This trait defines the recursive structure of our flattening logic:

```rust
pub trait DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T> {
    type DeepFlatten: Iterator<Item = T>;
    fn deep_flatten(this: Self) -> Self::DeepFlatten;
}
```

- `Depth` tracks the nesting level.
- `T` is the type of the innermost element.
- `DeepFlatten` is the resulting iterator after flattening.

#### Base Case: No Nesting

The base condition stops recursion when the structure is already flat:

```rust
impl<I: Iterator> DeepFlattenIteratorOf<(), I::Item> for I {
    type DeepFlatten = Self;

    fn deep_flatten(this: Self) -> Self::DeepFlatten {
        this
    }
}
```

Here, when `Depth` is `()`, no further flattening is needed, and the iterator is returned as-is.

#### Recursive Case: Flatten Nested Items

For nested structures, the recursion continues until reaching the base case:

```rust
impl<Depth, I, T> DeepFlattenIteratorOf<(Depth,), T> for I
where
    Flatten<I>: DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T>,
    I: Iterator,
    I::Item: IntoIterator,
{
    type DeepFlatten = <Flatten<I> as DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T>>::DeepFlatten;

    fn deep_flatten(this: Self) -> Self::DeepFlatten {
        DeepFlattenIteratorOf::deep_flatten(this.flatten())
    }
}
```

- `Flatten<I>` handles one level of flattening.
- The recursion continues until it reaches the base case.

#### Wrapper Struct for Type Inference

The `DeepFlatten` struct simplifies type inference by wrapping the recursive logic:

```rust
pub struct DeepFlatten<Depth, I, T>
where
    I: DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T>,
{
    inner: I::DeepFlatten,
}

impl<I: Iterator> DeepFlattenExt for I {}
```

This allows users to call the `.deep_flatten()` method directly:

```rust
pub trait DeepFlattenExt: Iterator + Sized {
    fn deep_flatten<Depth, T>(self) -> DeepFlatten<Depth, Self, T>
    where
        Self: DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T>,
    {
        DeepFlatten {
            inner: DeepFlattenIteratorOf::deep_flatten(self),
        }
    }
}
```

#### Iterator Implementation for `DeepFlatten`

Finally, the iterator implementation allows seamless iteration over flattened items:

```rust
impl<Depth, I, T> Iterator for DeepFlatten<Depth, I, T>
where
    I: DeepFlattenIteratorOf<Depth, T>,
{
    type Item = T;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        self.inner.next()
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

Here’s how you can use the `deep_flatten` method to flatten nested structures:

```rust
fn main() {
    let nested_vec = vec![
        vec![vec![1, 2, 3], vec![4, 5]],
        vec![vec![6], vec![7, 8, 9]],
    ];

    let flattened: Vec<i32> = nested_vec.into_iter().deep_flatten().collect();

    assert_eq!(flattened, vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);

    println!("Flattened result: {:?}", flattened);
}
```
