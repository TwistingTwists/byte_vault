  <Question>
    Explain the key differences between relational databases and document databases. 
    When would you choose one over the other?

        Here are the key differences between relational and document databases:
        
        1. **Schema**: 
          - Relational: Rigid, predefined schema
          - Document: Flexible, schema-less design

        2. **Data Model**:
          - Relational: Data normalized across tables
          - Document: Denormalized, nested documents

        3. **Scalability**:
          - Relational: Vertical scaling primarily
          - Document: Easier horizontal scaling

        Choose Relational when:
        - Data consistency is crucial
        - Complex queries and joins are needed
        - ACID compliance is required
        
        Choose Document when:
        - Schema flexibility is needed
        - Rapid prototyping
        - Handling large amounts of unstructured data
        - Horizontal scaling is a priority
