- generate a summary of codebase
- Generate title with framework (title, body summary, audience, rating, alex hormozi value framework)

---- framework
```
title: "Sample Title"
Body_summary: 
 providing a generic HTTP client framework with features like redirects and proxy support.focuses on managing asynchronous request bodies for HTTP requests. It includes:Implementation of AsyncRead, ensuring the body can be read asynchronously, which is crucial for streaming data.
Testing support with BlockedHttpClient, which always fails (useful for scenarios where network access is blocked), and FakeHttpClient, which allows mocking HTTP responses for testing purposes.


audience: rust developers, curious engineers looking for leveling up the software skills


When you generate the title for the blog, also analyse the value delivered using the following formula for value:

Value = ( DreamOutcome x PerceivedLikelihood Of Achievement ) /  (time delay x effort and sacrifice)

It consists of 4 variables.

Value is directly proportional to  2 variables = DreamOutcome x PerceivedLikelihood Of Achievement.

ANd Value is inversely proportional  to other two variables =  time delay x effort and sacrifice.

Here is what those 4 variables in value equation mean.

Dream outcome: What is the dream outcome that you want to achieve?

Perceived likelihood of success: How likely do you think it is that you will achieve this outcome?

Perceived time to success: How long do you think it will take to achieve this outcome?

Perceived difficulty of success: How difficult do you think it will be to achieve this outcome?

DO the value analysis of your title.

For each of the variables above, generate a table with the following columns (and give numbers out of 5. larger  number indicates better outcome )
dream outcome, Perceived likelihood of success, Perceived time to success, Perceived difficulty of success

    You are an expert content strategist and business analyst. Analyze the given content to:
    1. Generate an engaging, SEO-friendly title
    2. Calculate the potential value using this formula:
    Value = (DreamOutcome × Likelihood) / (TimeDelay × Effort)

    Rate components on a scale of 0-5 (whole numbers only) except for timeDelay which is in days.
    Consider audience impact, and increasing the value proposition in your analysis.

    Give a list of 5 options for content and value proposition for each one in following format.
    
    {{ ctx.output_format }}

    {{ _.role("user") }} {{ content }}
