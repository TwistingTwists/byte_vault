Neat bash script example.
We'll learn about `>&2` and `pushd` and `popd` in this script.

```bash

set -euo pipefail # -e: exit on error, -u: treat unset vars as error, -o pipefail: fail if any command in a pipeline fails

exit_failure=1

project_root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

yeet_name=${1:-}
location=$project_root

render_file_template() {
  if [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]; then
    sed -i '' "s/$1/$2/g" $3
  else
    sed -i "s/$1/$2/g" $3

This is a bash script I found on internet. It uses some very good patterns.




Here’s a progression of examples—from the simplest to more advanced—showing how and why you’d redirect output to stderr with constructs like `>&2`.

---

#### 1. Basic: Send a message to stderr

By default, `echo` writes to **stdout** (file descriptor 1). To send it to **stderr** (fd 2) instead:

```bash
echo "Oops, something went wrong!" >&2
```

This is equivalent to:

```bash
echo "Oops, something went wrong!" 1>&2
```

Here:

* `1>` means “take stdout (fd 1)”
* `2` is the target (stderr, fd 2)

Use this when you want your message to count as an error (so it won’t be mixed with normal output if someone is piping or capturing only stdout).

---

#### 2. Intermediate: Functions and logging

Wrap stderr-writes in a helper function for cleaner code:

```bash
log_error() {
  echo "ERROR: $*" >&2
}

# usage
if ! cp "$src" "$dst"; then
  log_error "Failed to copy $src to $dst"
  exit 1
fi
```

Here, any call to `log_error "…”` goes to stderr, keeping it separate from “happy-path” output.

---

#### 3. Redirecting entire blocks

You can redirect **all** output in a block to stderr:

```bash
{
  echo "Step 1 passed"
  echo "Step 2 passed"
  echo "Final check failed!"
} >&2
```

Everything inside `{ … }` now writes to fd 2.

---

#### 4. Advanced: Using `exec` for global redirection

If you want your entire script (or a large section) to send stdout to stderr, you can `exec`:

```bash
# At top of script, before any output:
exec 1>&2

echo "This goes to stderr"
# any subsequent echo also goes to stderr
```

You can even swap streams:

```bash
# Swap stdout and stderr for the remainder of the script:
exec 3>&1 1>&2 2>&3 3>&-
```

After this:

* What was stderr goes to stdout
* What was stdout goes to stderr

---

#### 5. Super-advanced: Custom descriptors & logging to files

Unix supports more fds than just 0,1,2. You can open your own:

```bash
# Open fd 3 for appending to a logfile:
exec 3>>/var/log/my_script.log

# Send normal info to fd 3:
echo "All OK so far" >&3

# Send errors to stderr as usual:
echo "Fatal error" >&2

# Restore/close when done:
exec 3>&-
```

This lets you:

* Keep “info” messages in a log file via fd 3
* Keep “errors” distinct on stderr

---

#### Why stderr vs. stdout?

1. **Separation of concerns**

   * **stdout** → data/results
   * **stderr** → diagnostics/errors

2. **Safe piping**


   ```bash
   myscript.sh | grep Success
   ```

   only sees stdout successes, not debug or error chatter.

3. **Better automation**

   Tools can capture or redirect each stream independently.


---

### Rundown of `pushd`/`popd`, from simple to advanced:

1. **Basic directory stack**

   ```bash
   pushd /path/to/dir    # cd into DIR, and push old cwd onto a stack
   popd                  # pop the top stack entry and cd back to it
   ```

   *Use when you need to temporarily work in another directory and then return.*

2. **Inspecting & nesting**

   ```bash
   pushd /one
   pushd /two
   dirs                  # shows stack order: /two /one /original
   popd                  # returns to /one (next entry on stack)
   ```

   *Stack lets you nest multiple switches without manually tracking each path.*

3. **Rotating through entries**

   ```bash
   pushd A B C           # push A, then B, then C; cwd ends at C
   dirs                  # C B A
   pushd +1              # rotate: bring second entry (B) to top; cwd=B
   pushd +2              # now rotates third (A) to top; cwd=A
   ```

   *Quickly cycle among saved locations by index instead of full paths.*

4. **Silent switching**

   ```bash
   pushd /tmp > /dev/null 2>&1  
   popd  > /dev/null 2>&1
   ```

   *Suppresses the usual “stack” output when you just want the directory change.*

5. **Robust scripting**

   ```bash
   pushd "$dir" || { echo "Cannot enter $dir" >&2; exit 1; }
     # perform actions in $dir…
   popd || exit 1
   ```

   *Combine with error checks to ensure you always return (or bail) on failure.*

---

**Why use it?**

* **Convenience:** No need to save and restore `$OLDPWD` manually.
* **Clarity:** `dirs` shows your navigation history.
* **Flexibility:** Rotate and jump by index for quick context switches.
