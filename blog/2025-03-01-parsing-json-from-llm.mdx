### Ensuring Deterministic Outputs from LLMs

There are several strategies to obtain structured outputs from LLMs.

In Python, libraries such as Pydantic and Instructor facilitate structured output via JSON schema-based tool invocation. If you have the capability to host your own model, sglang is a viable option.

Pydantic validators are highly effective, provided that the input is in the form of a valid JSON string.

Let's see by example. For starters, here is the schema we want to parse.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

class User(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    email: str
    active: bool = True  # default value

# JSON representation of the data
json_data = '''
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
}
'''

try:
     # Directly validate and parse the JSON string
    user = User.model_validate_json(json_data)
    print("Validated Data:", user)
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Validation Error:", e.json())

```
This works. Pydantic has a pretty solid _json_ to data model convertor. But it has to be a valid json string. Let's explore further.

```python

# JSON representation of the data
# typical replies of a small LLM which does not adhere well to 'output_json' command
json_data = '''
Here is your json
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
}
'''

try:
     # Directly validate and parse the JSON string using the new method
    user = User.model_validate_json(json_data)
    print("Validated Data:", user)
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Validation Error:", e.json())


```


Error is: 
```python 
Validation Error: [{"type":"json_invalid","loc":[],"msg":"Invalid JSON: expected value at line 2 column 1","input":"\nHere is your json\n{\n    \"id\": 123,\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"email\": \"alice@example.com\"\n}\n","ctx":{"error":"expected value at line 2 column 1"},"url":"https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/v/json_invalid"}]
```

Now, let's add one more step in the mix. Let's use the json_partial_py library to parse the JSON string. and then pass it to pydantic.


```python

from json_partial_py import to_json_string # <---- this is a new import

# typical replies of a small LLM which does not adhere well to 'output_json' command
json_data = '''
Here is your json
{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Alice",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
}
'''

try:
    stringified_json = to_json_string(json_data)
     # Directly validate and parse the JSON string using the new method
    user = User.model_validate_json(stringified_json)
    print("Validated Data:", user)
except ValidationError as e:
    print("Validation Error:", e.json())


```

and voila!! Now you can rest assured that you will get clean json parsed from the LLM output.
