## Understanding Dirty Writes: A Database Isolation Problem

### What is a Dirty Write?

A **dirty write** occurs when multiple transactions try to update the same data concurrently without proper isolation,
potentially causing one transaction to overwrite changes made by another uncommitted transaction.

This can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results in applications, especially in systems where multiple users or processes are accessing and modifying the data concurrently.

### Example Scenario

Let's walk through a concrete example to see how a dirty write can happen.

#### Initial Database State

Suppose we have a simple database table:

| key  | value    |
| ---- | -------- |
| name | abhishek |
| age  | 42       |

Two transactions, **T1** and **T2**, will interact with the `name` row.

---

### Step-by-Step: Dirty Write in Action

#### 1. T1 Reads the Original Value

- **T1** starts and reads the value of `name`.
- It sees:  
  `name = 'abhishek'` (the committed value).

#### 2. T2 Updates the Value (But Doesn't Commit)

- **T2** starts and updates `name` to `'john'`.
- This change is **not yet committed** to the database.
- Other transactions should ideally not see this uncommitted value.

#### 3. T1 Reads Again (Dirty Write!)

- **T1** reads the value of `name` again.
- **Because the database isolation level is low (e.g., READ UNCOMMITTED), T1 sees `name = 'john'`**, even though T2 hasn't committed.
- This is a **dirty write**: T1 is reading data that might be rolled back.

#### 4. T2 Commits

- **T2** now commits its change.
- `name = 'john'` is now the official, permanent value.

#### 5. T1 Commits

- **T1** commits, possibly basing its logic on the dirty value it read earlier.

## Why is This a Problem?

If **T2** had rolled back instead of committing, **T1** would have read a value that never officially existed in the database. This can cause application bugs, data corruption, or security issues.

## Visualizing the Dirty Write

The animation below demonstrates this scenario step-by-step. You can see how the database and transactions interact, and exactly when the dirty write occurs.

## Conclusion

Dirty writes are a classic example of why database isolation levels matter. By default, most production databases avoid dirty writes by using stricter isolation (like READ COMMITTED or higher). However, understanding this scenario helps you appreciate the trade-offs between performance and consistency in concurrent systems.
